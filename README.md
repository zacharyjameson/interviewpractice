Live coding practice interview question
=======================================

## Overview

This is a FullStack Todo Application, the client is based on [Todo MVC](http://todomvc.com/)

- Stack:
  - Client: Basic jQuery selectors, event-handlers, DOM manipulation and AJAX
  - Web Server: Node and Express with PostgreSQL 
  - Database: Locally hosted PostgreSQL 
  - Tests: Supertest, Chai

## The Rules

As in previous interviews, you may consult official docs and reference-style resources during this coding challenge. You are encouraged to work through as much of it on your own as you can.

## Setup
- Clone this repository to your local machine
- Install the dependencies for the project
- Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running
- Create a User for this exercise
- Create a database for the exercise with your user as the owner
- Rename the `example.env` file to `.env` and update the following fields with your database credentials:
  ```
   MIGRATION_DB_NAME=
   MIGRATION_DB_USER=
   MIGRATION_DB_PASS=
   DB_URL="postgresql://USERNAME@localhost/DATABASE_NAME"
  ```
- Run the command `npm run migrate -- 1` to create the database tables
- run the command `npm t`
- You should see output from 10 integration tests, all will be passing.

> **NOTE:** Due to some deployment requirements you will need to use Postgres version 8
> if you are using Node 14. Use Postgres version 7 if you are using Node 12. To change
> your version of Node you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script).
> 
> If you decide to use Node 12 and Postgres 7 you will need to set
> `ssl: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"` in postgrator-config  and `pg.defaults.ssl = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"` in `server.js`


## Exercise

- Todo Router
  - Create a new file name `todo-router.js` in the *todo* directory
  - Move all the endpoints from `app.js` to `todo-router.js`
  - Require the proper modules into todo-router.js and export the router
  - In app.js, mount the router on /v1/todos/ path (aka mount point)
  - Remember to update the paths on the router files.

You have completed the task when all the unit tests pass and the client application works without any errors.
